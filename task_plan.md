# Task Plan: Update Theme Colors to Match Palette

## Goal
Update all theme files in the omarchy-koda repo to use colors from pallete.lua as the source of truth.

## Phases
1. **Analyze Current Colors**: Read all theme files to identify current color usage and compare against palette.
2. **Update Files**: Replace hardcoded colors with palette references where possible, or match the palette colors.
3. **Verify Consistency**: Ensure all files use the same color scheme from the palette.
4. **Test**: Run any available lint/build commands to ensure changes are valid.

## Status
- Phase 1: Completed
- Phase 2: Completed
- Phase 3: Completed
- Phase 4: Completed (no linting commands available)
